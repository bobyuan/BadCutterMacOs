---

## Phase 0 — Setup ✅

- [x] Commit training-pool work on `main` (`8b82745`)
- [x] Create `v2-redesign` branch
- [x] DESIGN.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md
- [x] ML model research → DESIGN.md §5 (keep TrackNetV3; adopt trajectory hit
      detection + audio onset upgrade + cheer signal; watch BST/RTMPose)
- [x] User picked UI direction: **A "Studio"** → DECISIONS.md D-003

## Phase 1 — Corrections Ledger (keystone) ✅

- [x] `Persistence/SessionModels.swift` (events, baseline, materializer) +
      `Persistence/SessionStore.swift` (videoID hashing, ledger append, load)
- [x] `CodableFrame` promoted from tests into app target; `frames.json` cache
      (JSON instead of .bin — matches TestData pattern, fast enough)
- [x] Wire `AppState` mutation points to emit events (`setPointReviewStatus`,
      boundary-drag commit via new `commitPointBoundary`, analysis completion,
      save-to-pool, export). Trim drags recorded via the adjacent *point*
      boundary only (trim IDs are regenerated on every derive → unstable; see
      D-006)
- [x] Restore session on video open (baseline + event replay + cached frames)
- [x] Undo/redo (⌘Z/⇧⌘Z) as ledger events (`undo`/`redo` are themselves
      appended — the ledger stays append-only)
- [x] `SessionStoreTests` (8 tests): identity stability, materialize,
      undo/redo semantics, pointAdded insert/renumber, ledger + baseline
      round-trips
- [x] All existing tests green after `xcodebuild clean` (HybridSegmenter,
      SegmentUtils, TrajectoryAnalyzer)

## Phase 2 — UI Shell Redesign ✅

- [x] Implement chosen option (Option A "Studio" per D-003): `StudioView`
      three-pane HSplitView + status bar; calibration presented as a sheet
- [x] Migrate player + timeline into center pane (`PlayerTimelinePane`, renamed
      from TimelineTabView; shared `TimelineController` for
      playhead/viewport/selection)
- [x] Migrate point list into inspector (`InspectorPane` Points section)
- [x] Absorb Rm Stats into Export panel; training UI into Models panel
      (Rm Stats histograms dropped — summary stats only)
- [x] Delete dead tab scaffolding (VideosTabView, ExportTabView,
      RemovalStatsTabView, TimelineViewPlaceholder, ContentViewModel)

## Phase 3 — Review Affordances ✅

- [x] Add-missed-point (timeline button + bare "A" shortcut; span heuristic:
      break's high-audio window ±1s padding within 3s of playhead, else ±4s,
      clamped to the break — `SegmentUtils.defaultAddedPointSpan`, 7 tests)
- [x] Added points flow into scoring/export/training-clip extraction (they are
      ordinary GamePoints materialized from `pointAdded`; timeline rally blocks
      now draw from active points so added ones render)
- [x] Review-state chips (auto/confirmed/edited/added/deleted) — derived from
      ledger effective corrections (`addedPointIDs`/`editedPointIDs`), not
      stored; rated points count as confirmed
- [x] 👍/👎 rating capture → ledger (`highlightRated`, audit-only/not undoable;
      re-tap clears via rating "none"; derived map restored with the session)

## Phase 4 — Highlight Scoring (heuristic) ✅

- [x] `HighlightScorer`: 6 features + percentile normalization + weighted sum
      (plus `HitDetector` per §5.1: trajectory descending→ascending direction
      changes fused with audio onsets — feeds hitCount/tempo)
- [x] Score badges + sort in point list (Time/Score toggle; score mode ranks
      flat across games); top-K slider (top-K rows get filled star)
- [x] Golden tests over 5 cached videos (top-3 start times pinned) + 6 unit
      tests over synthetic trajectories/audio

## Phase 5 — Export Policies ✅

- [x] `ExportPlan` model; `VideoExporter.run(jobs:)` (AppState builds the job
      list; passthrough when matching source format, re-encode fallback)
- [x] Scoring reel + highlight reel (`HighlightScorer.select`:
      topPercent/topMinutes/threshold, 4 tests) + individual clips
      (`<base>.clips/G<g>_point<nn>.mov`)
- [x] Per-reel summary (pre-export estimates from source bitrate + post-export
      actuals with show-in-Finder); removed dead `ExportConfig`/`ExportMode`

## Phase 6 — Model Lifecycle + Config Unification ✅

- [x] Versioned model registry (`models/<name>/vNNN/` + metadata.json +
      `current.json` pointer; legacy flat model migrates to promoted v001 —
      verified live)
- [x] Shadow eval: replay corrected sessions' cached frames through the
      pipeline; IoU≥0.5 matching → precision/recall/F1, boundary MAE,
      added-point recall; gate holds on F1 regression (ε 0.02) or added-point
      recall drop. NOTE: replay evaluates the segmentation over cached frames —
      candidate-vs-current audio scoring differences need audio re-extraction
      (deferred to Phase 8 with the vDSP onset upgrade)
- [x] Promote/revert UI in Models panel (version list with metrics + held-gate
      reason; one-click Promote / Revert to)
- [x] Move hardcoded `HybridSegmenter` constants into `AnalysisConfig` (19
      fields: blend weights, Otsu clamp, merge/roll constants, dip weights +
      sensitivity ladder; defaults identical — golden + segmentation suites pin
      behavior unchanged)
- [x] `ShadowEvalTests` (12 tests: IoU, matching, aggregation, gate, registry
      round-trip/promote/revert/migration)

## Phase 7 — Learned Ranker + Polish ✅

- [x] Tabular ranker from ratings (≥30) with gated rollout (`HighlightRanker`:
      pool from session ledgers, MLLinearRegressor over the shared percentile
      features, pairwise concordance metric, highlight_ranker registry + gate;
      promoted ranker replaces heuristic weights in `refreshHighlightScores`,
      Models panel section w/ rating count + versions). NOTE: not yet exercised
      with 30 real ratings — unit tests cover train/predict/concordance
- [x] Score overlay on scoring reel (`AVVideoCompositionCoreAnimationTool`;
      badge pre-rendered to CGImage — CATextLayer doesn't render in the export
      pipeline; timed per-point visibility; verified in exported frames)
- [x] Crossfade transition (A/B alternating tracks, 0.5s opacity + audio-mix
      ramps, fade capped at half the shortest segment; verified: reel duration
      shrank by exactly 10 fades and a boundary frame shows the blend)

## Phase 8 — ML Upgrades ✅

- [x] vDSP audio-onset hit timing (`AudioSignalExtractor.detectOnsets`: RMS
      envelope → rectified flux → adaptive threshold; fused into `HitDetector`
      in place of quantized audio edges; cached per session as `audio.json`)
- [x] Crowd-excitement signal (`SNClassifySoundRequest` .version1
      applause/cheering/crowd → cheer timeline → 90/10 blend into highlight
      scores, heuristic and ranker paths alike)
- [x] Goldens preserved (cached-frames replay passes no audio signals)
- [ ] Deferred (watch-list per §5.2): TrackNetV4/WASB/BST swaps; D-007
      candidate-audio shadow re-scoring; venue profiles (§3.6 step 2)

---

## Post-v2 — Feedback-Driven Adjustment ✅

- [x] 👎 reason menu (8 reasons; taste vs detection split per D-008)
- [x] `PointAdjuster` auto-fix engine (7 unit tests; refuses low-evidence fixes)
- [x] Tune UI: zoom-to-point, ghost boundaries, per-edge play/nudge/set-here,
      Undo/Done — all via ledger
- [x] Live-verified: decline path, auto-fix path (−10.4s start move), ⌘Z restore

## History

| Date | What happened |
|---|---|
| 2026-07-18 | Reviewed codebase (pipeline + UI/feedback-loop audit). Identified gaps G1–G8. Committed training-pool refactor to `main` (`8b82745`). Created `v2-redesign`. Wrote DESIGN/PROGRESS/DECISIONS docs. Launched background research on badminton ML models (TrackNet successors, ShuttleSet/CoachAI, pose, audio, highlights). |
| 2026-07-18 | ML research completed → DESIGN.md §5: TrackNetV3 stays (open SOTA); adopt trajectory-based hit detection (Sensors 2024, F1 90.5 fused) + vDSP audio onsets + SNClassifySoundRequest cheer signal; noted competitor RallyCut. User picked UI Option A "Studio". Started Phase 1 (corrections ledger). |
| 2026-07-18 | **Phase 1 complete.** SessionStore + SessionModels (append-only ledger.jsonl, baseline.json, frames.json, meta.json per content-hashed videoID). AppState wired: events on delete/restore/boundary-commit/pool-save/export; session auto-restores on video open; ⌘Z/⇧⌘Z undo-redo via event replay. Drag handles in TimelineTabView now commit net boundary change on release. 8 new tests + existing suites green. |
| 2026-07-18 | **Phase 2 complete.** Studio layout replaces 4 tabs: single window with LibraryPane / PlayerTimelinePane / InspectorPane (Points, Export, Models) in an HSplitView, status bar, calibration sheet. New `TimelineController` shares playhead/viewport/selection across panes. Deleted dead tab views + ContentViewModel. Rm Stats histograms dropped (summary only). Build clean, SessionStore + SegmentUtils tests pass, app launches. Commit delayed to next session by terminal TCC permission loss (`30a9dc3`). |
| 2026-07-18 | **Phase 3 complete** (`0ff1912`). Add Point button in timeline footer (bare "A" shortcut) inserts an undoable `pointAdded` correction with high-audio-window default span. Review chips per point row derived from the ledger; 👍/👎 buttons record `highlightRated` events and survive session restore. 7 new span-heuristic tests; SegmentUtils + SessionStore suites green; build clean; UI render verified by screenshot (interactive flow needs a video analysis — not yet exercised). |
| 2026-07-19 | **Phase 4 complete** (`19b7b76`). New `HighlightScorer.swift`: `HitDetector` (trajectory vy direction-changes + audio-onset fusion) and 6-feature percentile-weighted scoring per DESIGN §3.4. AppState recomputes on every point mutation; Points panel gains star badges, Time/Score sort, top-K slider. Golden top-3 pinned for all 5 cached videos (e.g. IMG_8510: 6.6/686.8/501.2s). All suites green. New-file pbxproj registration done (explicit refs). |
| 2026-07-19 | **Phase 5 complete** (`3edc392`). ExportPlan/ExportOutput models, HighlightScorer.select policies, job-based VideoExporter with passthrough+fallback, rebuilt Export panel (reel toggles, selection slider, estimates, results). **Full E2E verified via UI automation on IMG_6155.rallies.mov**: import → analyze (11 pts) → chips/👍(confirmed chip)/score-sort/top-K → Add Point (added chip, renumber, rescore) → ⌘Z undo (rating survives) → dual-reel export (h264 passthrough, 65.1s + 22.0s, sizes shown). Known polish: point rows too cramped at min inspector width (chips/badges wrap). |
| 2026-07-19 | **Phase 6 complete** (`4a8e1c7`). ModelRegistry (vNNN dirs + current pointer, legacy migration verified live in app), ShadowEval engine + promotion gate, trainFromPool now train→register→shadow-eval→gate→promote/hold, Models panel version list w/ metrics + promote/revert. 19 shuttle-primary constants lifted into AnalysisConfig, defaults pinned by test suites (all green incl. goldens). Limitation noted: shadow replay can't yet re-score audio with a candidate model (needs audio re-extraction — Phase 8). |
| 2026-07-19 | **Phase 7 complete** (`1ffe670`). HighlightRanker (ledger-derived rating pool → MLLinearRegressor → concordance-gated registry rollout; heuristic fallback), score overlay + crossfade in a new composed VideoExporter path (A/B tracks, audio ramps). Debug win: CATextLayer renders blank inside AVVideoCompositionCoreAnimationTool — replaced with pre-rendered CGImage badge. E2E on restored session: 60.5s reel (10 fades applied), "1:0" badge at 2s, mid-blend + "2:0" at 5.45s. Ranker awaits 30 real ratings for live exercise. |
| 2026-07-19 | **Phase 8 complete** (`64d7b41`) — **all 8 phases done**. AudioSignalExtractor: vDSP onsets + built-in-classifier cheer timeline, one audio pass per analysis, session-cached. HitDetector fuses precise onsets; cheer blends 90/10 into scores. Verified live on fresh 22s analysis (72 onsets, 43 cheer samples, quiet-gym max 0.079). Inspector widened — point rows finally fit on one line. Also discovered: user analyzed IMG_8510 + rated 2 points overnight in the stale app instance — ledger captured everything (rating pool now 3 across 2 videos). Batch "Analyze Selected" skips already-done videos (restored sessions count as done) — a force-reanalyze affordance may be wanted later. |
| 2026-07-19 | **Feedback-driven adjustment** (`ad78bb2`, on main post-merge). 👎 → reason menu; PointAdjuster auto-fixes boundaries from presence/motion/onsets; tune bar with ghost boundaries; D-008 keeps detection complaints out of the ranker pool. Live-verified both the decline path and a −10.4s auto-fix + undo. |
| 2026-07-20 | **Tune-handle + scrub + feedback-escalation fixes** (`05ad3e9`). Orange boundary handles on the tuned point drag past the current boundary (neighbor-clamped); playhead scrub knob + drag-to-scrub on the trim strip; repeated 👎 reasons always act — fixed fallback nudge when the signal declines, and flush-neighbor merge (absorb next/previous point) for ends-too-early / starts-too-late. Live-verified flush merge + double-undo. |
| 2026-07-20 | **Analysis history** (`fb8f9ac`). Versioned runs (runs/rNNN + current pointer, run-tagged ledger, auto-migration of flat sessions), History inspector tab (per-run cards + full adjustment audit trail + local-storage guarantee), version pill w/ switcher + orange "(older)" state, re-analyze confirmation ("keep history" in the button). Ranker pool spans all runs; shadow corpus uses current run (D-009). Live-verified: migration, re-analysis → r002 with r001 untouched, switch-back restoring hand-tuned state. |
